In my free time I would print images of different types of airplanes and label all the different parts. At that time, my favorite film was \"Top Gun\". I also had a flight simulator and I ended up with more than 100 hours of flight. ðŸ¤£",

How I love those books... Currently, I am reading the last book of \"A Song of Ice and Fire\".\n\nHow many colors have you seen so far?"
